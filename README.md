# Payments-Microservice
This solution allows a parent institution create and manage and receive payments from content creators on their platform.

The Project contains three entities and Controllers.
The first two is meant to simulate content creators and their respective contents,while the last is to simulate the payment process.
Please endeavour to create a content creator,then a content,and finally make payment for that exact content.
Please ensure the above is followed in that order.
Java 11 was used in this development.
Onion Architecture was used in the development of this project to simulate the controller,service and repository in that order.
